              <p>
                The Sámi have long desired for a public process and an
                engagement to examine and expose the Nordic states’
                colonial, assimilationist policies toward the Sámi people.
                (1)
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2018 Norway established “The commission to investigate
                the Norwegianisation policy and injustice against the Sámi
                and Kven/Norwegian Finnish peoples”. In 2021, both Finland
                and Sweden moved forward on truth and reconciliation
                commissions of their own to document historical violations
                and their contemporary consequences on the Sámi. Yet
                public knowledge about the truth commissions in Norway,
                Finland and Sweden are lacking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Critics of the commissions doubt the intention of Nordic
                governments for reconciliation when current policies
                continue to violate rights, for example by promoting both
                extractive projects and “green colonialism” in the form of
                harmful sustainability projects which could destroy
                traditional ways of life already under threat from the
                climate emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just consider the February 2023 protests in Oslo, where
                young Sámi protesters had to barricade government
                buildings to get the Norwegian state to listen to their
                demands for the enforcement of a Supreme Court ruling 500
                days after they found the construction of industrial wind
                farms in Fosen illegal.
              </p>
              <p>
                How can past injustices be reconciled within the ongoing
                structures of colonialism? To address this question, we
                interviewed and met with Sámi activists, archeologists,
                historians, journalists, and researchers and examined
                cartographic evidence, photographs and other archival
                sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is while working on the research for this project that
                we became part of a legal action between Sámi herders of
                the Jillen-Njaarke reindeer herding district and Øyfjellet
                wind farm in Norway. We conducted a series of
                participatory workshops with herders and collected
                environmental data combined with the herders’ own videos,
                to create a 3D environment of the disputed site, towards
                counter-mapping the colonial present in Sápmi.

                In 2018 Norway established “The commission to investigate
                the Norwegianisation policy and injustice against the Sámi
                and Kven/Norwegian Finnish peoples”. In 2021, both Finland
                and Sweden moved forward on truth and reconciliation
                commissions of their own to document historical violations
                and their contemporary consequences on the Sámi. Yet
                public knowledge about the truth commissions in Norway,
                Finland and Sweden are lacking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Critics of the commissions doubt the intention of Nordic
                governments for reconciliation when current policies
                continue to violate rights, for example by promoting both
                extractive projects and “green colonialism” in the form of
                harmful sustainability projects which could destroy
                traditional ways of life already under threat from the
                climate emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just consider the February 2023 protests in Oslo, where
                young Sámi protesters had to barricade government
                buildings to get the Norwegian state to listen to their
                demands for the enforcement of a Supreme Court ruling 500
                days after they found the construction of industrial wind
                farms in Fosen illegal.
              </p>
              <p>
                How can past injustices be reconciled within the ongoing
                structures of colonialism? To address this question, we
                interviewed and met with Sámi activists, archeologists,
                historians, journalists, and researchers and examined
                cartographic evidence, photographs and other archival
                sources.

                It is while working on the research for this project that
                we became part of a legal action between Sámi herders of
                the Jillen-Njaarke reindeer herding district and Øyfjellet
                wind farm in Norway. We conducted a series of
                participatory workshops with herders and collected
                environmental data combined with the herders’ own videos,
                to create a 3D environment of the disputed site, towards
                counter-mapping the colonial present in Sápmi.
